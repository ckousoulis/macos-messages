macOS Messages
==============

macOS Messages is an open source tool built to help macOS users manipulate
chat archives (.ichat files) managed by the Messages (previously iChat)
application.

With the command-line interface, anyone can merge chats from a backup into 
the main archive. The commands and user experience are modeled after diff and
merge tools commonly used in software development.

Running
-------

from source
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Clone the `macos-messages`_ repository.
2. From the repository root directory, run:

  .. code-block:: text

    $ python -m messages ~/Library/Messages/Archive

from install
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. ``pip install path/to/tarball``
2. From anywhere within the Python environment, run:

  .. code-block:: text

    $ macos-messages ~/Library/Messages/Archive

3. Run commands to merge, inspect, and prepare changes to the target archive.
4. When ready, run ``flush`` to write the archive changes to disk.

* ``results``: Enumerates the full paths to chats that match the last search.
* ``ignore``: Marks the chats from the last search to be ignored in the merge.
* ``simulate``: Fakes a ``flush`` and displays its output to the console.

* ``help``: Shows help text with a list of commands.
* ``quit``: Exits the shell, as does ``^d`` for end of file.

Developing
----------

* Install packages: ``lorem``, ``pylint``
* Lint the source files in accordance with `Google's Style Guide`_
* Create fake archives for testing commands with ``generate_archives.py``
* Inspect the extended attributes of an archive with ``xattr_printer.py``
* Package with ``python setup.py sdist``
